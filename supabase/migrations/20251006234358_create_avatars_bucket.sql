  # Create Storage Bucket for User Avatars

  1. Storage
    - Create 'avatars' bucket for user profile pictures
    - Enable public access for reading avatars
    - Restrict uploads to authenticated users (own files only)
  
  2. Security
    - Users can upload their own avatars
    - Users can update their own avatars
    - Users can delete their own avatars
    - Everyone can view avatars (public read access)
